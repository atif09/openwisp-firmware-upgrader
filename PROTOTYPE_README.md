# Firmware Metadata Extraction Prototype

This file explains the architectural changes and core logic implemented
for the firmware metadata extraction prototype. These changes allow
OpenWISP Firmware Upgrader to automatically extract metadata from OpenWrt
firmware images at upload time, eliminating manual metadata entry.

## Overview of Changes

The prototype introduces an asynchronous extraction pipeline that runs
immediately after a firmware image is uploaded. Metadata is extracted
using fwtool (primary) and DTB scanning (fallback), populating board,
compatible, target, and version fields automatically. Images remain
unconfirmed until extraction completes, preventing use in upgrades until
metadata is verified.

---

## Prerequisites

To run the prototype end-to-end, ensure the following are installed:

- **`fwtool`**: system binary used for primary metadata extraction. Install via your package manager (e.g. `apt install fwtool` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **Python packages**: install requirements which include `fdt` and `lz4`:

```
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

## How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atif09/openwisp-firmware-upgrader.git
cd openwisp-firmware-upgrader
git checkout automatic-metadata-fwtool-dtb-extraction
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
apt install fwtool  # or equivalent for your OS
```

For starting the dev server and Celery worker, follow the [developer installation docs](https://openwisp.io/docs/stable/firmware-upgrader/developer/installation.html).

Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`, create a build first (if not already present), then go to the `Firmware` section in the sidebar, click on `Builds`, click on your build, add a Firmware Image, the extraction will run in the background.

## How It Works: The Lifecycle

The system uses an asynchronous, signal-driven architecture to handle
metadata extraction without blocking the upload request.

### Trigger

When a firmware image is uploaded, magic bytes and rootfs filename checks
run synchronously. If both pass, the file is saved with
`extraction_status = unconfirmed` and a Celery task is queued.

### Background Task

`extract_firmware_metadata` runs the extraction in two steps:

- **fwtool** (primary): reads the JSON trailer from sysupgrade images.
  No decompression needed.
- **DTB scan** (fallback): if fwtool fails, decompresses the kernel and
  uses `fdt` to locate the Device Tree Blob.

### Outcomes

- Both succeed → `status = success`, metadata fields populated
- Both fail → `status = failed`, `failure_reason = unsupported_format`
- Malformed file → `status = invalid`, all fields locked

### Manual Takeover

On failure, metadata fields are unlocked in the admin. The operator fills them in and saves. `save_model()` transitions the status to manually_confirmed. Once the image reaches `success` or `manually confirmed`, all metadata fields become read-only.

### Build-Level Status

`_update_extraction_status()` aggregates image statuses after each
extraction. The build becomes usable for mass upgrades only when all
images reach `success` or `manually_confirmed`. A `generic_notification`
fires when the build transitions out of `analyzing`.

## Key Features Verified

- **Upload validation**: JPEG, PNG, PDF, ZIP, and executable files rejected
  immediately via magic bytes check. `*-squashfs-rootfs.img` rejected by
  filename.
- **fwtool extraction**: board, compatible, target, fw_version,
  compat_version populated automatically on sysupgrade images.
- **DTB fallback**: board and compatible extracted from FIT and sdcard
  images where fwtool finds no trailer (ipq40xx, sunxi).
- **Graceful failure**: x86 and armsr fail cleanly to
  `unsupported_format`, unlocking manual input fields.
- **Manual takeover**: operator fills in metadata after failure, status
  transitions to `manually_confirmed` on save.
- **Field locking**: metadata fields become read-only after `success` or
  `manually_confirmed` at admin level.
- **Build-level status**: build blocks mass upgrades until all images are
  confirmed. Adding a new image resets status to `analyzing`.
- **Notifications**: `generic_notification` sent on extraction failure
  (image-level) and on build completion (build-level), both with direct
  admin links.
- **Decompression safety**: size cap and ratio limit enforced during
  kernel decompression. `DecompressionLimitExceeded` recorded as
  `out_of_memory`.
- **Cross-version compatibility**: `compat_version > 1.0` blocks
  auto-pairing to prevent network breakage during swconfig-to-DSA
  migration.
